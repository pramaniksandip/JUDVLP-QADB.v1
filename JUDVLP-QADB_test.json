                    "context": "No. 24(1)/2020-DPD-Part(2).\u2014 1. The Government is taking various initiatives to promote digital payments. Over past few years, digital payment transactions have witnessed tremendous growth across the country with the number of transactions growing from 2,071 crore in FY 2017-18 to 5,554 crore in FY 2020-21. In the present Covid pandemic, digital payments enable safety for citizens through contact-less modes of payments as well as provide impetus to the economy. 2. Although there has been unprecedented growth in digital payments over the past few years, there is potential for further growth as cash continues on a significant scale. It is, therefore, important to boost the adoption of digital payments, targeting untapped markets/ segments/ sectors. 3. In compliance with the Budget announcement (FY 2021-22) and to give further boost to digital transactions in the country, it has been decided by the Government to incentivise the acquiring Banks by way of paying percentage of value of RuPay Debit cards transactions (P2M) and low-value BHIMUPI transactions (upto \u20b9 2,000) (P2M), for a period of one year w.e.f. April 01, 2021. 4. The incentive to the acquiring banks will be provided by the Government at the following rates: vii. Reimbursement of the claims will be done on quarterly basis. On successful submission of the claims, 95% of the claimed amount will be reimbursed to the Banks after each quarter. The remaining 5% of the claimed amount of each quarter will be released at the end of last quarter of the scheme. To reduce the financial burden on the Government, lower incentive rate has been proposed on transactions done at merchants under Industry Programmes, as mentioned above. ii. MeitY, in consultation with NPCI, may review from time to time the utilization of funds under the scheme and accordingly include/ exclude the Industry Programmes. iii. The duration of the proposed scheme is one year, w.e.f. April 01, 2021. iv. The estimated financial outlay of the scheme is \u20b9 1,300 crore. v. The allocation of \u20b9 1,300 crore will be fungible between RuPay Debit cards and BHIM-UPI. vi. The Banks are required to show at least 10% YOY growth rate in number of RuPay Debit card transactions (overall, not restricted to P2M) and 50% YOY growth rate in number of BHIMUPI transactions (overall, not restricted to P2M) at the end of last quarter of the scheme. viii. MeitY will review the growth of RuPay Debit card (volume) and BHIM-UPI (volume) transactions of each bank at the end of last quarter. The pending amount of the previous three quarters (5% per quarter) would be released with the claimed amount of the last quarter, only if the Bank meets the specified growth rate, as mentioned in Para vi. above, else the retained amount, i.e., 5% per quarter of the previous three quarters and 5% of the claimed amount of the last quarter will not be released to the Bank. ix. The incentive will be shared by the acquiring banks with other stakeholders. The distribution of the incentive amongst the stakeholders will be decided by NPCI in consultation with the Banks. x. The Scheme is applicable to the Banks having operations in India and transactions done in India. xi. The operational guideline for implementation of the scheme will be issued to the acquiring banks by MeitY in consultation with NPCI",

India\u2019s share in the global hardware electronics production is about 3%. The share of domestic electronics production in India\u2019s GDP is 2.3%. The import of electronic goods was of the order of USD 53 billion (approximately INR 3,44,500 crore) in 2017-18. With the demand for electronics hardware expected to rise rapidly to about USD 400 billion (approximately INR 26,00,000 crore) by 2025, India cannot afford to bear a huge foreign exchange outgo on import of electronics alone. This is both an opportunity and a challenge for the electronics sector. Opportunity to be a global leader and challenge to address a severe Balance of Payments (BoP) problem, which cannot be addressed by manufacturing for India alone. This calls for measures to promote large eco-system for domestic manufacturing, a special emphasis on exports and increasing domestic value addition. Specific policy initiatives are required to meet these objectives",

Large-scale cyber incidents may overwhelm the government, public and private sector resources and services by disrupting functioning of critical information systems. Complications from disruptions of such a magnitude may threaten lives, economy and national security. Rapid identification, information exchange, investigation and coordinated response and remediation can mitigate the damage caused by malicious cyberspace activity. Some of the examples of cyber threats to individuals, businesses and government are identity theft, phishing, social engineering, hactivism, cyber terrorism, compound threats targeting mobile devices and smart phone, compromised digital certificates, advanced persistent threats, denial of service, bot nets, supply chain attacks, data leakage, etc. The protection of information infrastructure and preservation of the confidentiality,integrity and availability of information in cyberspace is the essence of a secure cyber space",

Further, for your own security and security of our country, it is advised to verify identity of all mobile subscribers using an identifier like Aadhaar.

If any government official of a department denies the benefits or services for lack of Aadhaar or failure of verification for technical reasons contrary to the relevant notification, a complaint should be lodged against the concerned authorities of those departments for such unlawful denials. Complain to higher authorities in case of denial of services. Eaadhaar (downloaded Aadhaar) from UIDAI website is as legally valid as original Aadhaar issued by UIDAI. eAadhaar, Aadhaar Letter or mAadhaar Profile, all should be accepted by all Agencies. In fact, downloaded eAadhaar or mAadhaar profile have updated details of the Aadhaar holders and therefore, these should be preferable.  If any official/ agency/ department refuses to accept downloaded eAadhaar, the Aadhaar holder may lodge complaint with the concerned authorities of those departments/ agencies. Aadhaar has benefited a common person in several ways. Foremost is - with a credible identity.  Aadhaar has empowered almost all residents of the country with a widely trusted verifiable identity. Acquiring of this verifiable identity has led to financial inclusion for the unbanked rural people in remote areas of the country. They can use their Aadhaar to open bank accounts and get government benefits directly in their accounts. Aadhaar-based services like Aadhaar-enabled Payment System (AePS) have helped bring bank services to remote villages and towns. The elderly are able to use door-step banking access to their government benefits.With a portable identity like Aadhaar, people now have a means to prove their identity for jobs, travel and services like bank accounts, gas connections, mobile SIMs etc. This has led to social inclusion for the migrant population in the country. With Aadhaar based e-KYC, many service providers have been able to achieve paper-less user verification and instant services. This has not just benefitted customers, but has also helped save time, effort and money for the service providers.",

Enabling Aadhaar for various services like Government & Non-Government Services, Subsidy Benefits, Pensions, Scholarships, Social Benefits, Banking services, Insurance services, Taxation services, Education, Employment, Healthcare etc., makes it essential to ensure that Aadhaar data of the resident stored in the CIDR is accurate and up-to-date. Demographic data update, the need could arise from: Changes in life events such as marriage may lead to residents changing their basic demographic details such as name and address. Address and mobile number could also change due to migration to newer locations. Residents may also want changes in their relative\u00e2\u0080\u0099s details due to changes in life events such marriage, death of a relative etc. In addition, residents could have other personal reasons to change their mobile number, email address etc. Changes in various service delivery platforms may lead residents to declaration request changes and to add mobile number to CIDR etc. Errors made during the enrolment process wherein the resident\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demographic data may have been captured incorrectly.

Later, the resident may want to change the local language of enrolment to another that he/she prefers. If so, then all the demographic information that is printed on the Aadhaar letter will need to be updated in the new local language. UIDAI may also ascertain availability of POI, POA and other documents collected at the time of enrolment/update and its quality and decide to notify resident to update their demographic information and submit the required document.",

Update Client Standard\nFields: All biometric and demographic fields as well as local language can be updated\nIdentity Authentication: Biometric check at the back-end.\nDocument Verification \n    Verification done for those fields which require documentary evidence.\n    Verification done by verifier appointed by UIDAI/Registrars present at Enrolment / Update Centre.\n    The verification procedure followed should be in line with DDSVP Committee Recommendations followed during enrolment process\nForm Filling and Acknowledgement\n    Done by the operator on update client as requested by the resident. Handles spelling, language issues, transliteration, etc. Operator will provide biometric sign off against every update request.\nResident gets an acknowledgement receipt with Update Request Number (URN) which can be tracked.\nBiometric Update Process: Step 1 - Filling Application Form, Step 2 - Manual Verification of proof, Step 3 - Entry of Data into client software by operator, Step 4 - Biometric Authentication by Resident, Step 5 - Operator & Supervisor's Confirmation, Step 6 - Acknowledgement of Receipt\nb. Update Client Lite (UCL)\nFields: All demographic fields and Photo as well as local language can be updated.\nIdentity Authentication: Boimetric Authentication of resident.\nDocument Verification\n    Verification done for those fields which require documentary evidence\n    Verification done by verifier appointed by UIDAI/Registrars present at Enrolment / Update Centre.\n    The verification procedure followed should be in line with DDSVP Committee Recommendations followed during enrolment process\nForm Filling and Acknowledgement\n    Done by the operator on update client as requested by the resident. Resident gets an acknowledgement receipt with Update Request Number (URN) which can be tracked. Operator will provide biometric sign off against every update request.\nc. Update through AUA Point of Presence\nThis mode will be used by select Registrar who will also become AUA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. UIDAI may provide application / APIs for Update. The Registrars selected for such updates will be Registrars known to collect/generate/possess and/or manage the particular demographic field and is a custodian of such data.\nFields: Demographic fields\nIdentity Authentication: Biometric Authentication of resident on the AUA device; UIDAI may decide to use other/additional authentication factors, if required. For example mobile OTP, for taking update requests from this mode.\nOperator will provide biometric sign off against every update request. Thus they must have Aadhaar. Auth standards of UIDAI will be applicable for device/s used.\nDocument Verification: UIDAI will accept update based on Registrar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s verification process and Resident Authentication. For audit purposes, electronic/scanned document copies may be collected online. These document copies may be captured and received with each resident request, or may be made available, by the Registrar, in batches against the Update Request Numbers, Date and time.\nForm Filling and Acknowledgement",

The participating Institutions of GPAT-2022 are the Institutions which will be accepting the GPAT Scores. 3.2 NTA does not verify the information provided by the candidates during online registration and hence candidature will be purely provisional subject to fulfilment of eligibility criteria as per AICTE norms. 3.3 NTA has no role in counselling for admission to the Masters (M.Pharma) program. Candidates must apply separately to the desired GPAT-2022 Participating institutions with the GPAT Score 2022. Thereafter, each Participating Institute will release their respective cut off GPAT Scores which a candidate should meet to get qualified for admission to that particular Institution. Once qualified, the 5 candidates will have to comply with the selection procedure of that particular Institution, which may comprise of Group Discussion (GD) and Personal Interview (PI). The final selection of the candidate will be based on the candidate\u2019s performance in GD & PI. 3.4 Candidates are advised to read the details of the admission process of each Participating Institute of GPAT-2022 on their respective websites.",

The candidates will be given different sets of questions per session and it is quite possible that in spite of all efforts of maintaining equivalence among various question papers, the difficulty level of these question papers administered in different sessions may not be exactly the same. Some of the candidates may end up attempting a relatively tougher set of questions when compared to other sets. The candidates who attempt the comparatively tougher Examination are likely to get lower marks as compared to those who attempt the easier one. In order to overcome such a situation, \u201cNormalization procedure based on Percentile Score\u201d will be used for ensuring that candidates are neither benefitted nor disadvantaged due to the difficulty level of the examination. With the objective of ensuring that a candidate\u2019s true merit is identified, and that a level playing field is created in the above context, the Normalization Procedure, set out below shall be adopted, for compiling the NTA scores for multi session papers. The process of Normalization is an established practice for comparing candidate scores across multi session papers and is similar to those being adopted in other large educational selection tests conducted in India. For normalization across sections, NTA shall use the percentile equivalence. Percentile Scores: Percentile scores are scores based on the relative performance of all those who appear for the examination. Basically, the marks obtained are transformed into a scale ranging from 100 to 0 for each session of examinees. The Percentile Score indicates the percentage of candidates that have scored EQUAL TO OR BELOW (same or lower raw scores) that particular Percentile in that examination. Therefore, the topper (highest score) of each session will get the same Percentile of 100 which is desirable. The marks obtained in between the highest and lowest scores are also converted to appropriate Percentiles. The Percentile score will be the Normalized Score for the Examination (instead of the raw marks of the candidate) and shall be used for preparation of the merit lists. The Percentile Scores will be calculated up to 7 decimal places to avoid bunching effect and reduce ties.

To address\nthis need, the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation (DAC), Govt. of India has introduced the\nAgricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) Scheme by merging the earlier\nGrameenBhandaranYojana (GBY) and the Scheme for Development/Strengthening of Agricultural\nMarketing Infrastructure, Grading and Standardization (AMIGS).\nAgricultural biotechnology is an advanced technology that allows plant breeders to make precise\ngenetic changes to impart beneficial traits to the crop plants we rely on for food and fiber. For\ncenturies farmers and plant breeders have labored to improve crop plants. Traditional breeding\nmethods include selecting and sowing the seeds from the strongest, most desirable plants to produce\nthe next generation of crops. By selecting and breeding plants with characteristics such as higher\nyield, resistance to pests and hardiness, early farmers dramatically changed the genetic make-up of\ncrop plants long before the science of genetics was understood.

It will help to reduce transportation cost of farmers\nproduce from the farm gate to the mandis. It will also help in reducing post-harvest losses.

Further the scheme has been extended for a further period of 2 years i.e. upto March\n31, 2024\nThe FAME scheme was introduced in April 2012 to be implemented over a period of 6 years till\n2020 to support hybrid/electric vehicles market development and its manufacturing. Under this\nscheme, demand incentives will be availed by buyers (end users/consumers) upfront at the point of\npurchase and the same shall be reimbursed by the manufacturers from Department of Heavy\nIndustries, on a monthly basis. The Union government recently announced its decision to extend the\nsecond phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME)\nscheme by two years to March 31, 2024\nThe demand incentive benefit will be passed on to the consumer upfront at the time of purchase of\nthe xEV itself by way of paying reduced price\nPresently scheme is applicable in selected areas like as notified separately broadly covering following\ncities: a) Cities under \u2019Smart Cities\u2019 initiatives. b) Major metro agglomerations \u2013 Delhi NCR, Greater Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad. c) All State Capitals and other\nUrban Agglomerations/Cities with 1 Million+ population (as per 2011 census) d) Cities of the North\nEastern States. However, for 2 and 3 wheeler, scheme is applicable in entire country.\nPhase I of the scheme is a sort of pilot project just to see the reaction of people to the electric and\nhybrid vehicles. If this phase is successful, in next phase, scheme will be applicable throughout the\ncountry.\nYes, the demand incentive will be available for all types and self-capitalized vehicles as well.\nYes, the demand incentive will be applicable for fleet operators for commercial applications as well.\nYes, the OEM can bill the vehicle and customer may avail the demand incentive.\nYes, the incentive will be available to corporate and organizations.\nYes, an individual may buy multiple xEVs and avail the demand incentive applicable for each of them.\nThe fact is that a typical conventional hatchback has 130-140 gm/km of CO2 emission comparing to\nan electric vehicle for 100 gm/km when charged by grid and when solar charged, there is ~0 gm/km\nCO2 emission from an electric vehicle.\nNo, there is no such condition in the present guidelines.\nDemand incentive under FAME India scheme is available only to vehicles that are regulated by the\nCentral Motor Vehicle Rules (CMVR) and meet other qualifying criteria laid out in the FAME scheme.\nAs such these vehicles meet all the safety regulations as applicable in the country.\nNo, as per scheme guidelines, incentive will be on reimbursement basis only after submission of\nclaim. This claim required to be submitted only after sale of vehicles.\nSome of the key concerned industry associations for automobiles and components are: Society of\nIndian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) Automotive Component Manufacturers Association (ACMA)\nThe Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI)\nNational Automotive Board is the apex body dealing with automotive sector.\nThe Ministry of Heavy Industries, Government of India, deals with areas related to vehicles and\nautomotive parts. Entire Automotive industry falls under the concern of Heavy Industries Ministry.\nThe PLI Scheme for the auto sector envisages to overcome the cost disabilities of the industry for\nmanufacture of Advanced Automotive Technology products in India. The incentive structure will\nencourage industry to make fresh investments for indigenous global supply chain of Advanced\nAutomotive Technology products. It is estimated that over a period of five years, the PLI Scheme for\nAutomobile and Auto Components Industry will lead to fresh investments of over Rs 42,500 crores,\nincremental production of over Rs 2.3 lakh crore and will create additional employment\nopportunities of over 7.5 lakh jobs.

TReDS covers clearing and\nsettlement activities and is regulated as a payment system under the Payment and Settlement\nSystems Act 2007.\nRBI regulates payments-related activities in India and issues circulars and directions applicable to\ndifferent payments-related activities. Payment services are regulated under the Payment and\nSettlement Systems Act 2007. A payment system is defined as \u2018a system that enables payment to be\neffected between a payer and a beneficiary, involving clearing, payment or settlement service or all\nof them, but does not include a stock exchange\u2019. These include credit cards, debit cards, smart cards\nand money transfers. Any entity interested in commencing a payment system is required to obtain\nauthorisation from RBI. The payment providers broadly fall under the following categories: payment\naggregators and payment gateways, prepaid payment instruments, financial market infrastructure\n(clearing houses), retail payment organisations, card payment networks (Visa, MasterCard, etc), cross\u0002border money transfers, ATM networks, white-label ATM operators and instant money transfer.\nThere are three types of prepaid payment instruments: open payment instruments, which are\npayment instruments that can be used to make a payment to any merchant; semi-closed, which are\npayment instruments that can be used to make payment to a defined set of merchants; and closed,\nwhich are payment instruments of a merchant for payment only to that merchant.\nPPIs are instruments that facilitate purchase of goods and services, conduct of financial services,enable remittance facilities, etc., against the value stored therein.\nPPIs can be issued by banks and non-banks. Banks can issue PPIs after obtaining approval from RBI.\nThe non-bank PPI issuers are companies incorporated in India and registered under the Companies\nAct, 1956 / 2013. They can operate a payment system for issuing PPIs to individuals / organisations\nafter receiving authorisation from RBI. A holder of a PPI is an individual who obtains / purchases the\nPPI from the PPI issuer. However, in case of a gift PPI, any other intended / targeted beneficiary,\nthough not being the purchaser, can also be a holder.\nThe list of PPI issuers is available on the RBI website.\nPPIs that require RBI approval / authorisation prior to issuance are classified under two types: \na) Small PPIs (or minimum-detail PPIs): These PPIs are issued by banks and non-banks after\nobtaining minimum details of the PPI holder. These PPIs can be used for purchase of goods and\nservices at a group of clearly identified merchant locations / establishments which have a specific\ncontract with the issuer (or contract through a payment aggregator / payment gateway) to accept the\nPPIs as payment instruments. Funds transfer or cash withdrawal from such PPIs is not permitted. \na) Full-KYC PPIs: The PPIs are issued by banks and non-banks after completing Know Your\nCustomer (KYC) of PPI holder. These PPIs can be used for purchase of goods and services, funds\ntransfer or cash withdrawal.\nThese PPIs are issued by an entity for facilitating the purchase of goods and services from that entity\nonly. Cash withdrawals are not permitted. These instruments cannot be used for payment or\nsettlement for third party services. The issuance or operation of such instruments is not classified as a payment system requiring approval / authorisation by RBI and are, therefore, not regulated or\nsupervised by RBI.\nSmall PPIs can be of two types: a) PPIs upto \u20b9 10,000/- (with cash loading facility). These PPIs\nshall be converted into full-KYC PPIs within 24 months. b) PPIs upto \u20b9 10,000/- (with no cash\nloading facility).\nPPIs can be loaded / reloaded by cash (not permitted in one type of Small PPI), debit to a bank\naccount, credit and debit cards, PPIs (as permitted from time to time) and other payment instruments\nissued by entities regulated in India and in Indian Rupees (INR) only. The cash loading of PPIs is\nlimited to \u20b9 50,000/- per month subject to overall limit of the PPI (not permitted in one type of\nSmall PPI). The limit on loading of PPIs via electronic / online means is subject to overall limit of the\nPPI.\nA Small PPI (with cash loading facility) can be held for a maximum period of 24 months only. The 24\nmonths shall be counted from the day of opening such a PPI. Within this period of 24 months, it has\nto be converted into a full-KYC PPI failing which, no further credit in such PPI shall be allowed.\nHowever, the PPI holder shall be allowed to use the available balance.\nPPI issuers shall give an option to the \u2018Full-KYC\u2019 PPI holders to close the PPI and transfer the\nbalance to bank account as per the applicable limits of this type of PPI. For this purpose, the issuer\nshall provide an option at the time of issuing the PPI, to the holder to provide details of pre\u0002designated bank account or other PPI to which the balance amount available in the PPI shall be\ntransferred in the event of closure of PPI, expiry of validity period of such PPIs, etc. At the time of closure, a holder can specify a bank account which is different from pre-designated account given\nearlier.\nFull-KYC PPIs issued by Authorised Dealer Category-I banks, can be used in cross-border outward\ntransactions for permissible current account transactions under FEMA viz. purchase of goods and\nservices. This facility shall be enabled only on explicit request of a PPI holder. Bank and non-bank\nPPI issuers, who are Indian agents of the authorised Overseas Principal (OP), are permitted to issue\nfull-KYC PPIs to beneficiaries of inward remittance under the Money Transfer Service Scheme (MTSS)\nof the RBI. It means that the entity undertaking this activity needs to be an authorised PPI issuer as\nwell as an Indian Agent under MTSS (authorised by Foreign Exchange Department, RBI).\nYes, it is mandatory for a PPI issuer to allow interoperability. It is mandatory for the PPI issuer to\ngive the holders of full-KYC PPIs interoperability through authorised card networks and UPI. All\nmodes of acceptance (including QR codes) and PPI issuance are required to be interoperable by\nMarch 31, 2022.\nNational Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) is a nation-wide centralised payment system owned and\noperated by the RBI.\nYes, the person having no bank account can remit funds through NEFT to a beneficiary having a\nbank account, with another NEFT member bank. It can be done by depositing cash at the nearest\nNEFT enabled branch of any bank, by furnishing additional details such as complete address,\ntelephone number, etc. Such cash remittances will, however, be restricted to a maximum of \u20b9\n50,000/- per transaction.\nYes, NEFT can be used to transfer funds from / to NRE and NRO accounts in the country.

Explanation.\u2014For the purposes of this sub-section,\u2014 (i) \"event of default\" means failure to pay or deliver or honour the obligations of a qualified financial contract, or bankruptcy, or any other event as may be agreed upon by the parties in the agreement; and (ii) \"termination event\" means the occurrence of any event mentioned in the netting agreement which gives one or both parties the right to terminate relevant transactions under that agreement. (2) The parties to a qualified financial contract shall ensure that all obligations owed by one party to another party under a qualified financial contract are reduced to or replaced with single net amount which has the following effect, namely:\u2014 (a) the termination, liquidation or acceleration of any present or future payment or delivery rights or obligations arising under or in connection with any one or more qualified financial contracts to which a netting agreement applies; (b) the calculation or estimation of a close-out value, market value, liquidation value or replacement value in respect of each right and obligation or group of rights and obligations terminated, liquidated or accelerated under clause (a) and the conversion of each such value into a single currency; and (c) the determination of the net balance of the values calculated under clause (b), whether by operation of set-off or otherwise, giving rise to the obligation of one party to pay an amount equal to the net balance to the other party. (3) Without prejudice to the provisions of any law for the time being in force requiring the realisation, appropriation or liquidation of collateral, and unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the realisation, appropriation or liquidation of collateral under a collateral arrangement shall take effect without any requirement of prior notice to, or consent from, any party, person or entity. (4) Close-out netting shall be applicable to all qualified financial market participants who are parties to a qualified financial contract notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any law specified in the Second Schedule or any other law pursuant to which any qualified financial market participant has been incorporated, constituted or is regulated. 7. (1) Where parties to the qualified financial contract enter into a netting agreement, the net amount payable under the close-out netting shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the netting agreement entered into by the parties. (2) In the absence of the netting agreement, where the parties to a qualified financial contract fail to agree on the sum with regard to the net amount payable under the close-out netting, such sum shall be determined through arbitration.",

(2) The notice referred to in sub-section (1), shall also be issued to any other person who has any interest in the property mentioned in the application under sub-section (2) of section 4. (3) A notice under sub-section (1) shall\u2014 (a) require the individual to appear at a specified place and time not less than six weeks from the date of issue of such notice; and (b) state that failure to appear on the specified place and time shall result in a declaration of the individual as a fugitive economic offender and confiscation of property under this Act. (4) A notice under sub-section (1) shall be forwarded to such authority, as the Central Government may notify, for effecting service in a contracting State. (5) The authority referred to in sub-section (4) shall make efforts to serve the notice within a period of two weeks in such manner as may be prescribed.

(2) Where any individual to whom notice has been issued under sub-section (1) of section 10 fails to appear at the place and time specified in the notice, but enters appearance through counsel, the Special Court may in its discretion give a period of one week to file a reply to the application under section 4. (3) Where any individual to whom notice has been issued under sub-section (1) of section 10 fails to enter appearance either in person or through counsel, and the Special Court is satisfied\u2014 (a) that service of notice has been effected on such party; or (b) that notice could not be served in spite of best efforts because such individual has evaded service of notice, it may, after recording reasons in writing, proceed to hear the application. (4) The Special Court may also give any person to whom notice has been issued under sub-section (2) of section 10 a period of one week to file a reply to the application under section 4. 12.

(7) The Special Court may, while making the confiscation order, exempt from confiscation any property which is a proceed of crime in which any other person, other than the fugitive economic offender, has an interest if it is satisfied that such interest was acquired bona fide and without knowledge of the fact that the property was proceeds of crime. (8) All the rights and title in the confiscated property shall, from the date of the confiscation order, vest in the Central Government, free from all encumbrances.

                    "context": "There is no mechanism put up by Bahrain to verify the background of PIO/NRI prior to their marriage. Bahraini legal system has no provision for the dowry demand. There is only \u2018Mehr\u2019 system which is dealt with in accordance with Shariat law. Assistance of Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Immigration authorities of Bahrain are sought whenever any such request received from the spouse/family members from India, where Indian woman needs to find out the location or whereabouts of a husband in BAHRAIN. Government of Bahrain has opened a shelter where such cases are referred for redressal. The centre is equipped with all amenities. In addition the Migrant Worker Protection Society (MWPS), an NGO, also runs a shelter for women in distress.There is no provision in Bahrain to provide permanent residency of foreign woman/children abandoned by their spouses. The spouse/children generally come on the dependent visa which is co-terminous with the employment contract of the husband/father. They can stay in Bahrain only up to the period of contract of husband/father and 5required to go back unless visa is renewed/or sponsored by the old/new employer.As per the local laws the property is passed on from father to children directly and there are no provisions for Indian wife to inherit property of deceased husband. A few cases have been reported and legal aids were provided through local empanelled lawyers of the Embassy in case of Abuse/ Domestic violence/ Ill-treatment of wife by the NRI/PIO husband. No cases have been reported in the Embassy of this nature, till date where Child abduction charges on a wife by an overseas Indian husband. No cases have been reported in the Embassy of this nature, till date where Indian woman seek Child Custody when children and spouse are based abroad. The local Courts normally gives three chances to the accused to put forward his case. In case one of the parties to the case does not appear consecutively for three times, the Court can give ex parte decision/decree depending upon the nature of the case. However, no such case has been reported/come to the notice of Mission. The lawyer fees ranges from BD 1000 to 2000/- for the case i.e US $2,700/-to US $5,400/- depending upon the nature of the case and the standing of the lawyer hired to handle the casemay be considered. Minimum amount of US doller 3,000 should be taken into account to hire a lawyer of appropriate standing to present the case. Efforts are made to serve these notices to the person concerned through local Foreign Office/Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs. There are no such provisions in Bahrain for Indian Woman to avail Legal assistance by BAHRAIN Governments to the aggrieved woman to file case against an overseas Indian. Three treaties have been signed between the two governments in the area of judicial co-operation: Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal matters\u201d, \u201cJudicial and Judicial Co-operation in Civil and Commercial matters\u201d, \u201cExtradition Treaty\u201d. Summons/Arrest warrants received from Indian Courts are served by the Embassy through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs/Ministry of Justice of Bahrain. Indian and Bahrain has signed an agreement on \u201cMutual Legal Assistance in Criminal matters\u201d, \u201cJudicial and Judicial Co\u0002operation in Civil and Commercial matters\u201d and \u201cExtradition Treaty\u201d in 2004. Co-operation of local government is sought under the rovisions of the treaties signed with Bahrain. Local Government has no provision of extension of dependent visa of dependent wife/children in case spouse deserts them or divorces the wife. Bahraini system has provision of providing maintenance charges in respect of the children only up to the age of 18 years. No provision, however, exists for the spouses divorced by their husbands.",

                    "context": "The Canadian authorities do not share with the Consulate any personal information about a person, whether Indian or otherwise, in view of the strict privacy laws. Therefore, it would not be possible for this Mission to know the number of unregistered marriages of Indian women with overseas Indian spouses. The Mission has no locus standi to approach any Canadian authority or any person in Canada to inquire about the dowry demanded by any NRI/PIO spouse or his/her family living in Canada. One has to take recourse to the provisions of the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between the two countries for redressal of grievances. As already mentioned, the Canadian authorities do not share any information with the Consulate or any third person about the marital status of a PIO/NRI, in view of the strict privacy laws. The only way to know the marital status of an Indian national is checking of their PRIDE data which again cannot be said to be a true proof. Owing to strict Privacy laws, it is not possible for this Mission to approach any Canadian authority or private persons to find out the whereabouts of an Indian NRI/PIO spouse in Canada. There is no way this Mission can trace in Canada a fugitive spouse who has abandoned his/her Indian spouse. The local Canadian social services authorities do provide shelter and food to abandoned woman/children though they do not share such information with this Mission. The Canadian authorities grant permanent residency only to those women and children who are sponsored by the Indian NRI/PIO spouse.  An aggrieved Indian wife can file a case in Indian court for 50% of the foreign owned property of her spouse. However, the Canadian authorities do not recognise the court orders of India in such cases. She can also approach a lawyer in Canada after reaching here even on visitor visa, sponsored by anybody (not necessarily her husband). The Mission also received complaints of abuse/domestic violence/ill-treatment by Indian wives at the hands of their NRI/PIO husbands. However, the Mission cannot take up the matter with the concerned local police authorities as it has no locus standi in the matter due to strict privacy laws. In such cases, only the distressed Indian women can seek the assistance of local police/other authorities directly. Normally the Canadian immigration authorities ask for the consent letter if the child is travelling alone or with one parent. The HCI on its part also require the consent of both the parents at the time of issuing Indian visa to the minor child. Even if the mother is able to abduct a minor child holding Canadian nationality to India, the Canadian authorities file a court case and vigorously follow the matter with the concerned foreign authorities. In such cases, Consulate is not kept in the loop. The aggrieved Indian wife will have to seek the help of the local Canadian court. The custody of the child (who may be having Canadian nationality) can be given to the mother, who may even be holding Indian nationality. There have been many cases where the local courts have taken Ex parte decisions favouring Canadian citizens. However, it happens when the Indian women is not represented in the court case. The legal cost in Canada is huge and the amount may vary from case to case. If the divorce case is with mutual consent, it may be decided within six months - one year at a cost of Canadian $ 2000. However, if it is contested and goes for trial, the legal costs may be anywhere between Canadian doller 50,000 and beyond. As regards Servicing of judicial documents in Canada, including court orders/summons/show cause notices, it is regulated by reciprocal arrangements with Canada finalized and notified by the Ministry of Home Affairs, New Delhi, as per statutory provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code Section 105. MHA, which is the nodal Ministry and Central Authority for seeking and providing the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, receives all kinds of such requests, examines them and take appropriate action including taking up the matter with the CanadianDepartment of Justice, Ottawa. If the judicial documents are not sent under MLAT, the Canadian authorities do not take any action. Comprehensive guidelines in this regard can be seen on the website of the Ministry of Home Affairs (http://www.mha.nic.in). The local government provides free legal aid to aggrieved Indian women, if she is resident in Canada. Canadian Courts do take cognisance of the orders issued by the Indian courts only when these are forwarded to the Canadian Department of Justice, Ottawa by the Ministry of Home Affairs for further action under the MLAT. It is not possible to serve summons/arrest warrants issued by an Indian court against an NRI/PIO spouse living in Canada. The Canadian courts and other authorities do not take cognisance of such orders unless these are forwarded by MHA under MLAT to the Canadian Department of Justice. The visa cannot be extended unless so requested by the PIO/NRI husband. In almost all the cases, the distressed Indian wife who is located in India do not get any maintenance from her PIO/NRI husbands. If she is resident in Canada, she can take up the matter for maintenance with the Canadian Superior Court (Family branch).",

                    "context": "The Canadian authorities do not share with the Consulate any personal information about a person, whether Indian or otherwise, in view of the strict privacy laws. Therefore, it would not be possible for this Mission to know the number of unregistered marriages of Indian women with overseas Indian spouses. The Mission has no locus standi to approach any Canadian authority or any person in Canada to inquire about the dowry demanded by any NRI/PIO spouse or his/her family living in Canada. One has to take recourse to the provisions of the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between the two countries for redressal of grievances. As already mentioned, the Canadian authorities do not share any information with the Consulate or any third person about the marital status of a PIO/NRI, in view of the strict privacy laws. The only way to know the marital status of an Indian national is checking of their PRIDE data which again cannot be said to be a true proof. Owing to strict Privacy laws, it is not possible for this Mission to approach any Canadian authority or private persons to find out the whereabouts of an Indian NRI/PIO spouse in Canada. There is no way this Mission can trace in Canada a fugitive spouse who has abandoned his/her Indian spouse. The local Canadian social services authorities do provide shelter and food to abandoned woman/children though they do not share such information with this Mission. The Canadian authorities grant permanent residency only to those women and children who are sponsored by the Indian NRI/PIO spouse.  An aggrieved Indian wife can file a case in Indian court for 50% of the foreign owned property of her spouse. However, the Canadian authorities do not recognise the court orders of India in such cases. She can also approach a lawyer in Canada after reaching here even on visitor visa, sponsored by anybody (not necessarily her husband). The Mission also received complaints of abuse/domestic violence/ill-treatment by Indian wives at the hands of their NRI/PIO husbands. However, the Mission cannot take up the matter with the concerned local police authorities as it has no locus standi in the matter due to strict privacy laws. In such cases, only the distressed Indian women can seek the assistance of local police/other authorities directly. Normally the Canadian immigration authorities ask for the consent letter if the child is travelling alone or with one parent. The HCI on its part also require the consent of both the parents at the time of issuing Indian visa to the minor child. Even if the mother is able to abduct a minor child holding Canadian nationality to India, the Canadian authorities file a court case and vigorously follow the matter with the concerned foreign authorities. In such cases, Consulate is not kept in the loop. The aggrieved Indian wife will have to seek the help of the local Canadian court. The custody of the child (who may be having Canadian nationality) can be given to the mother, who may even be holding Indian nationality. There have been many cases where the local courts have taken Ex parte decisions favouring Canadian citizens. However, it happens when the Indian women is not represented in the court case. The legal cost in Canada is huge and the amount may vary from case to case. If the divorce case is with mutual consent, it may be decided within six months - one year at a cost of Canadian $ 2000. However, if it is contested and goes for trial, the legal costs may be anywhere between Canadian doller 50,000 and beyond. As regards Servicing of judicial documents in Canada, including court orders/summons/show cause notices, it is regulated by reciprocal arrangements with Canada finalized and notified by the Ministry of Home Affairs, New Delhi, as per statutory provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code Section 105. MHA, which is the nodal Ministry and Central Authority for seeking and providing the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, receives all kinds of such requests, examines them and take appropriate action including taking up the matter with the CanadianDepartment of Justice, Ottawa. If the judicial documents are not sent under MLAT, the Canadian authorities do not take any action. Comprehensive guidelines in this regard can be seen on the website of the Ministry of Home Affairs (http://www.mha.nic.in). The local government provides free legal aid to aggrieved Indian women, if she is resident in Canada. Canadian Courts do take cognisance of the orders issued by the Indian courts only when these are forwarded to the Canadian Department of Justice, Ottawa by the Ministry of Home Affairs for further action under the MLAT. It is not possible to serve summons/arrest warrants issued by an Indian court against an NRI/PIO spouse living in Canada. The Canadian courts and other authorities do not take cognisance of such orders unless these are forwarded by MHA under MLAT to the Canadian Department of Justice. The visa cannot be extended unless so requested by the PIO/NRI husband. In almost all the cases, the distressed Indian wife who is located in India do not get any maintenance from her PIO/NRI husbands.

Thus, it is difficult to get background checks on individuals. German authorities do not deem any marriage as legally valid unless it is registered under the civil law in Germany or India. NRI whose marriage is not registered cannot bring the spouse to Germany. If after the so-called \"Social marriage\" the husband goes abroad and the wife remains in India, it is seen as a personal matter between the two persons/families. The Mission will not come to know about such demands unless the person/family affected makes a complaint , where a spouse/parents-in-law who are living abroad demands dowry. This matter may be dealt with by the person concerned in India as per relevant provisions of the law. Legal system is strong in Germany if bigamy is proved. Moreover, before marriage, the prospective spouse/family in India can insist on a registration certificate of the NRI and a marriage eligibility certificate issued by the local authority where he/she is registered. An official request has to be made through the Court in India to the German government to find out the location or whereabouts of a husband in GERMANY. A strong legal system exists in case of disappearance or abandonment. An official request has to be made through the Court in India to the German government. There are a number of German NGOs which give advice, and in exceptional cases provide even shelter/material assistance. Some local German authorities have also such offices, which one can be approached. Residence permit is granted by the German local authorities based on the existing rules and administrative instructions. Each individual case varies and the local authorities take a decision based on the merit of each case. Police can take necessary legal action on basis of the complaint, in case of Abuse/ Domestic violence/ Ill-treatment of wife by the NRI/PIO husband. Ex parte decree/divorce takes place only when the spouse in India does not respond to Court summons. It is difficult to assess the legal costs. It varies depending on the fees of the lawyer, which vary, the number of sessions and the length of time spent in settlement of the case.For legal aid and filing a case, an amount ranging between Euro 3000 to Euro 5000 may be considered . This is shared with relevant local authorities for further action at their end , if a Look out circular of Overseas Indians sent by GOI to GERMANY. Police are approached to trace missing persons. No such facility is known to be available of Legal assistance by GERMANY Governments to the aggrieved woman to file case against an overseas Indian. Such cases are usually handled by private family lawyers or NGOs. Local Government handles such cases as per merits, with no clear guidelines. This needs to be settled through legal process.

                    "context": "One particular mechanism to verify ones background is to refer to their passport copy which states the nationality of a person. This will be relevant only for people who are Residents of the country not citizens. There is no legal document that is available to the general public that displays the background of a PIO/NRI. New Zealand recognizes the relationship of a de-facto partner. So a social marriage or a partnership (that has a genuine, stable and ongoing relationship) is recognized as a marriage. Overseas recognized or registered marriages are recognized in New Zealand.There is no specific provision on dowry law in NZ , if a spouse/parents-in-law who are living abroad demands dowry. Legally per the Crimes Act 1961, a person cannot marry in New Zealand if they are already married. Polygamy is a crime in NZ. However if a married person marries someone in another country (such as India in this scenario) the laws of that country will prevail. An adult cannot be forced to live with another adult in New Zealand. The next of kin or friends may be able to assist. Complaints may be lodged with the police, if there has been a fraud or deception. However, enforcement may be difficult. There are charitable organisations in NZ that provide shelter to abused/abandoned women. One such organisation is called Shakti New Zealand. This is only possible if the abandoned women and children are granted a refugee status. The Police may issue a support letter to assist with a visa or residence. However, this is on a case to case basis as there have been instances where this provision has been misused. An eligible partner may apply to the Family Court. There are a number of factors that the Court will look at including the length of relationship. Per the property law of New Zealand, if you\u2019ve been married, in a civil union or lived together for 3 years or more, any property that both partners own will be equally divided. New Zealand has strong domestic violence laws. Physical, sexual, psychological or financial abuse is considered part of domestic violence. One may obtain Police safety orders, or protection orders. One may apply for the care of children and custody of the child to the Family Court. It will be treated as abduction only if it is against the orders passed by the Court or if a child is being taken out of the country without the consent of the other guardian/parent. The best interests of the child are taken into account by the Family Court while weighing the factors such as abusive parent or unhealthy environment, other commitments and obligations of the parent, finances, health etc. Ex parte orders can be obtained if all steps laid down by the Court, for service of the other party, are followed and exhausted and the Court allows to proceed by ex parte proceedings. The legal costs depend on a case-to-case basis. Legal costs are very high in NZ and no exact amount can be provided. An amount of US doller 2000 to US doller 3,000 may be useful for initial assistance. However, the amount of total assistance required will depend upon each case and its complexity \u2013 domestic violence, separation, divorce, custody of children, property relationships etc. Each case has to be dealt with separately. Mission may have to seek the assistance of local authorities. However, NZ authorities do not reveal the whereabouts of any person owing to strict privacy laws.  New Zealand has legal aid provisions for eligible persons. Domestic violence cases are taken care of by the police prosecutions and assistance provided to the victim. However, in other property and civil matters legal aid may not be available to a non-resident. New Zealand Courts recognise the jurisdiction of Indian courts, however a decision made by an Indian court may be persuasive but not binding on the New Zealand courts.New Zealand Courts recognize the validity of a decree or legislative enactment for divorce or dissolution cases when one or both the parties are nationals or citizens of that country. The jurisdiction of other matters depends on case to case basis.However, owing to privacy laws, there are limits to which the orders of Indian courts are accepted and it has been the experience of this Mission that decisions of only the local authorities are accepted. New Zealand Courts, police or government agencies are not obliged to take necessary steps. The legal process has to be a private initiative to serve the summons/arrest warrants by following the due process of law. Usually the summons sent by the Mission are not accepted by the recipient and are returned to the Mission. Immigration New Zealand usually issues or extends the partnership visa only if a marriage or partnership is genuine, stable and ongoing. One may be eligible for visitor or other categories of visa depending upon the eligibility and circumstances of each individual. An eligible partner, if applies to the Court, may be granted maintenance to get him/her back on feet. This is usually for a short period. The Court will look into number of factors including other financial means, independency, capacity to work and earn, looking after children, any period of retraining required.",

In the present Covid pandemic, digital payments enable safety for citizens through contact-less modes of payments  as well as provide impetus to the economy. \n2. Although there has been unprecedented growth in digital payments over the past few years, there is  potential for further growth as cash continues on a significant scale.

In compliance with the Budget announcement (FY 2021-22) and to give further boost to digital  transactions in the country, it has been decided by the Government to incentivise the acquiring Banks  by way of paying percentage of value of RuPay Debit cards transactions (P2M) and low-value BHIM UPI transactions (upto \u20b9 2,000) (P2M), for a period of one year w.e.f.

Over past few years, digital  payment transactions have witnessed tremendous growth across the country with the number of  transactions growing from 2,071 crore in FY 2017-18 to 5,554 crore in FY 2020-21. In the present Covid pandemic, digital payments enable safety for citizens through contact-less modes of payments  as well as provide impetus to the economy. \n2. Although there has been unprecedented growth in digital payments over the past few years, there is  potential for further growth as cash continues on a significant scale. It is, therefore, important to boost the adoption of digital payments, targeting untapped markets/ segments/ sectors. \n3. In compliance with the Budget announcement (FY 2021-22) and to give further boost to digital  transactions in the country, it has been decided by the Government to incentivise the acquiring Banks  by way of paying percentage of value of RuPay Debit cards transactions (P2M) and low-value BHIM UPI transactions (upto \u00e2\u201a\u00b9 2,000) (P2M), for a period of one year w.e.f.

Stay of proceedings under certificate and amendment or withdrawal thereof.\u2014(1)  Notwithstanding that a certificate has been issued to the Recovery Officer for the recovery of any amount,  the authorised officer may grant time for the payment of the amount, and thereupon the Recovery Officer  shall stay the proceedings until the expiry of the time so granted. \n(2) Where a certificate for the recovery of amount has been issued, the authorised officer shall keep  the Recovery Officer informed of any amount paid or time granted for payment, subsequent to the issue  of such certificate. \n(3) Where the order giving rise to a demand of amount for which a certificate for recovery has been  issued has been modified in appeal or other proceeding under this Act, and, as a consequence thereof, the  demand is reduced but the order is the subject-matter of a further proceeding under this Act, the  authorised officer shall stay the recovery of such part of the amount of the certificate as pertains to the  said reduction for the period for which the appeal or other proceeding remains pending. \n(4) Where a certificate for the recovery of amount has been issued and subsequently the amount of the  outstanding demand is reduced as a result of an appeal or other proceeding under this Act, the authorised  officer shall, when the order which was the subject-matter of such appeal or other proceeding has become  final and conclusive, amend the certificate or withdraw it, as the case may be. \n8F. Other modes of recovery.\u2014(1) Notwithstanding the issue of a certificate to the Recovery  Officer under section 8B, the Central Provident Fund Commissioner or any other officer authorised by the  Central Board may recover the amount by any one or more of the modes provided in this section. \n(2) If any amount is due from any person to any employer who is in arrears, the Central Provident  Fund Commissioner or any other officer authorised by the Central Board in this behalf may require such  person to deduct from the said amount the arrears due from such employer under this Act and such person  shall comply with any such requisition and shall pay the sum so deducted to the credit of the Central  Provident Fund Commissioner or the officer so authorised, as the case may be: \nProvided that nothing in this sub-section shall apply to any part of the amount exempt from  attachment in execution of a decree of a civil court under section 60 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908  (5 of 1908). \n(3) (i) The Central Provident Fund Commissioner or any other officer authorised by the Central Board  in this behalf may, at any time or from time to time, by notice in writing, require any person from whom  money is due or may become due to the employer or, as the case may be, the establishment or any person  who holds or may subsequently hold money for or on account of the employer or as the case may be, the \nestablishment, to pay to the Central Provident Fund Commissioner either forthwith upon the money  becoming due or being held or at or within the time specified in the notice (not being before the money  becomes due or is held) so much of the money as is sufficient to pay the amount due from the employer in  respect of arrears or the whole of the money when it is equal to or less than that amount. \n(ii) A notice under this sub-section may be issued to any person who holds or may subsequently hold  any money for or an account of the employer jointly with any other person and for the purposes of this  sub-section, the shares of the joint-holders in such account shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved,  to be equal. \n(iii) A copy of the notice shall be forwarded to the employer at his last address known to the Central  Provident Fund Commissioner or, as the case may be, the officer so authorised and in the case of a joint  account to all the joint-holders at their last addresses known to the Central Provident Fund Commissioner  or the officer so authorised. \n(iv) Save as otherwise provided in this sub-section, every person to whom a notice is issued under this  sub-section shall be bound to comply with such notice, and, in particular, where any such notice is issued  to a post office, bank or an insurer, it shall not be necessary for any pass book, deposit receipt, policy or  any other document to be produced for the purpose of any entry, endorsement or the like being made  before payment is made notwithstanding any rule, practice or requirement to the contrary. \n(v) Any claim respecting any property in relation to which a notice under this sub-section has been  issued arising after the date of the notice shall be void as against any demand contained in the notice. (vi) Where a person to whom a notice under this sub-section is sent objects to it by a statement on  oath that the sum demanded or any part thereof is not due to the employer or that he does not hold any  money for or on account of the employer, then, nothing contained in this sub-section shall be deemed to  require such person to pay any such sum or part thereof, as the case may be, but if it is discovered that  such statement was false in any material particular, such person shall be personally liable to the Central  Provident Fund Commissioner or the officer so authorised to the extent of his own liability to the  employer on the date of the notice, or to the extent of the employer\u2019s liability for any sum due under this  Act, whichever is less. \n(vii) The Central Provident Fund Commissioner or the officer so authorisedmay, at any time or from  time to time, amend or revoke any notice issued under this sub-section or extend the time for making any  payment in pursuance of such notice. \n(viii) The Central Provident Fund Commissioner or the officer so authorised shall grant a receipt for  any amount paid in compliance with a notice issued under this sub-section, and the person so paying shall  be fully discharged from his liability to the employer to the extent of the amount so paid. \n(ix) Any person discharging any liability to the employer after the receipt of a notice under this  sub-section shall be personally liable to the Central Provident Fund Commissioner or the officer so  authorised to the extent of his own liability to the employer so discharged or to the extent of the  employer\u2019s liability for any sum due under this Act, whichever is less. \n(x) If the person to whom a notice under this sub-section is sent fails to make payment in pursuance  thereof to the Central Provident Fund Commissioner or the officer so authorised he shall be deemed to be  an employer in default in respect of the amount specified in the notice and further proceedings may be  taken against him for the realisation of the amount as if it were an arrear due from him, in the manner  provided in sections 8B to 8E and the notice shall have the same effect as an attachment of a debt by the  Recovery Officer in exercise of his powers under section 8B. \n(4) The Central Provident Fund Commissioner or the officer authorised by the Central Board in this  behalf may apply to the court in whose custody there is money belonging to the employer for payment to  him of the entire amount of such money, or if it is more than the amount due, an amount sufficient to  discharge the amount due. \n(5) The Central Provident Fund Commissioner or any officer not below the rank of Assistant  Provident Fund Commissioner may, if so authorised by the Central Government by general or special  order, recover any arrears of amount due from an employer or, as the case may be, from the establishment \nby distraint and sale of his or its movable property in the manner laid down in the Third Schedule to the  Income- tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961). \n8G. Application of certain provisions of Income-tax Act.\u2014The provisions of the Second and Third  Schedules to the Income-tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961) and the Income-tax (Certificate Proceedings) Rules,  1962, as in force from time to time, shall apply with necessary modifications as if the said provisions and  the rules referred to the arrears of the amount mentioned in section 8 of this Act instead of to the  income-tax: \nProvided that any reference in the said provisions and the rules to the \u201cassessee\u201d shall be construed as  a reference to an employer as defined in this Act.]",
